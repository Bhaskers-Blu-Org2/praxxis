## Introduction

mtool is a revolutionary task automation interface built on big data and machine learing. With all of the efficiency of tools like ktool, and the intelligence of machine learning, mtool learns from your habits to create intelligent pathways through your workflow.

## Features
##### Scenes
mtool scenes are situation-specific configurations that can be saved, closed, reopened and shared. Scenes store your habits and environment, allowing you to easily fix old problems, and get help with new ones.

##### Suggestions
With or without a big data cluster, mtool's suggestions are usable through trained machine learning models distributed by Microsoft. If you have your own big data cluster, you can top up or train a new model with your own data.

##### History
With mtool, a history of commands is preserved, allowing you to backtrack through problems and move forward quickly through complex systems. Since situation specific configurations are saved as environment variables in scenes, you'll always be able to track exactly what commands were run, what was changed, and where you need to go next.

##### Notebook Libraries
mtool runs on libraries of notebooks, allowing every command on your system to be documented and explained in a beautiful markdown format. mtool combines the idea of functional documentation with every part of a system, allowing every person on a team to operate with the same efficiency as even the most senior engineer, through generated suggestions and truly meaningful understanding.
