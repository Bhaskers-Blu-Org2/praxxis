## Introduction
mtool is built upon the idea of helping each other. Every day we are generating and wasting valuable data that could help solve each other’s problems. What if there was a centralized way of collect data? mtool does that! It collects and analyzes the exhaust emitted from your computer, and in doing so enables others to learn from your problems. In return, mtool helps you predict what you want to run next. We want mtool to empower everybody to learn from each other! 

mtool is a task interface built on big data and machine learing. It streamlines the process of running notebooks and elemenates the need to write/ memorize complicated series of commands. mtool includes all of the efficiencies of tools like ktool, and the intelligence of machine learning, mtool learns from your habits to create intelligent pathways through your workflow.

## Features
##### Scenes
mtool scenes are situation-specific configurations that can be saved, closed, reopened and shared. Scenes store your habits and environment, allowing you to easily fix old problems, and get help with new ones. Scenes store your environment variables and notebook history allowing you to easily share your working enviorment. When you share your scenes your peers are able to see the same outputs, predictions, and parameter values you see.

##### Predictions 
With or without a big data cluster, mtool's predictions are usable through trained machine learning models distributed by Microsoft. If you have your own big data cluster, you can top up or train a new model with your own data.

##### History
With mtool, a history of commands is preserved, allowing you to backtrack through problems and move forward quickly through complex systems. Since situation specific configurations are saved as environment variables in scenes, you'll always be able to track exactly what commands were run, what was changed, and where you need to go next.

##### Notebook Libraries
mtool runs on libraries of notebooks, allowing every command on your system to be documented and explained in a beautiful markdown format. mtool combines the idea of functional documentation with every part of a system, allowing every person on a team to operate with the same understanding as even the most senior engineer, through outcome driven, useful documentation.
